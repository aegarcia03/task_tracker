# Task tracker 

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this project, there is a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on.

The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

- Add, Update, and Delete tasks
- Mark a task as in progress or done
- List all tasks
- List all tasks that are done
- List all tasks that are not done
- List all tasks that are in progress
